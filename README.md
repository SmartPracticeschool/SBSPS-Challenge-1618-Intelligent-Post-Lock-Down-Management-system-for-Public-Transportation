# SBSPS-Challenge-1618-Intelligent-Post-Lock-Down-Management-system-for-Public-Transportation

Since this pandemic, the world has seen many changes and adopted certain habits and techniques in our daily lives, Social-Distancing or keeping certain distance from each other is best form of safeguarding us and our loved ones from this unseen threat, but we are not yet ready to maintain social distancing and safety measures post lockdown, when all essential and non-essential services will seize to resume.

Thus, we present a prominent and lasting solution by taking both current conditions and future estimates in consideration, an application which will help us maintain a distributed network of new age transportation avoiding maximum possibilities of crowd generation and traditional centralized way of boarding public transport and general public transport, to a new, more distributed transportation boarding and travelling system, also providing apt measures for non travelling users for better planned and precautionary visits and best advisories based on real time factors to minimize risk levels.
